   - `VCC`: 5V (NUCLEO)
   - `GND`: GND (NUCLEO)
   - `TRIG`: Connect to a GPIO pin (e.g., `PA9`).
   - `ECHO`: Connect to another GPIO pin (e.g., `PA8`).

2. **LCD 2004 with I2C Backpack**:
   - `SDA`: Connect to `PB7` (I2C1 SDA on NUCLEO-F411RE).
   - `SCL`: Connect to `PB6` (I2C1 SCL on NUCLEO-F411RE).
   - `VCC`: 5V (NUCLEO)
   - `GND`: GND (NUCLEO)

## üíª Software Description

The project is developed using **STM32CubeIDE** with HAL libraries.

### Key Functionalities:

1. **HCSR04 Sensor**:
   - Sends ultrasonic pulses using the `TRIG` pin.
   - Measures the duration of the echo signal to calculate distance.

2. **LCD 2004 Display**:
   - Configured to communicate over the I2C bus.
   - Displays the measured distance in centimeters.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Continuously triggers the HCSR04 sensor to measure distance.
   - Updates the LCD display in real time with the calculated distance.
